If you want to start learning web development but you're broke and can't afford coding bootcamps like me, here are some of the resources I used when I was starting out. I got a lot of advice from random strangers on the internet, so I want to write it all here just in case someone may find it useful.

Just like every journey there will be hardships. Learning a new skill can be frustrating, heck, I even asked myself if I'm smart enough to learn programming, but seeing myself improve day by day is enough to keep me going. I know I'm still on the early stage of my journey and I know that there will be even more harships that'll come my way, but what matters is being persistent in learning. Take a rest if you need to, but never quit. Be patient with the results and one day you'll be surprised on how far you've come.
