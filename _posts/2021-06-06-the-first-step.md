In this post I'll be writing about why I started learning programming and how I started. 

　You're probably wondering why I thought my journey to web development was unexpected. As a background, I studied civil engineering student who is unhappy about my major, so I dropped out. Then, following aunt's advice, I took a care-giving course so I can go to Canada and start all over again. Well.. guess what.. That plan got canceled too, and now I'm stuck at home with no idea what to do. That's when I started self-studying as a hobby. I started with learning Japanese. A year passed and I've met good people through language exchange, but I still wanted to learn more, and that's when I got the idea to start learning programming. 

I've always been interested in coding, and I always find building stuff fun. Why not build something with code, and that's when I decided to start learning. Equipped with the discipline and good study habits I acquired in a year of self-studying, I took my first step. I asked for advice all over the internet and someone advised me to start with web development.

Just like every journey there will be hardships. Learning a new skill can be frustrating, heck, I even asked myself if I'm smart enough to learn programming, but seeing myself improve day by day is enough to keep me going. I know I'm still on the early stage of my journey and I know that there will be even more harships that will come my way, but what matters is being persistent in learning. Take a rest if you need to, but never quit. Be patient with the results and one day you'll be surprised how far you've come.
