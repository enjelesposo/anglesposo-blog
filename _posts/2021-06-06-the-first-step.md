I've always been interested in coding, and I always find building stuff fun. Why not build something with code? I asked myself, and that's when I decided wanted to start learning. Equipped with the discipline and good study habits I acquired in a year of self-studying Japanese, I took my first step. I asked for advice all over the internet and someone advised me to start with web development.

I'm still beginner but here are the resources I used to start my journey as a self-taught web developer:

Just like every journey there will be hardships. Learning a new skill can be frustrating, heck, I even asked myself if I'm smart enough to learn programming, but seeing myself improve day by day is enough to keep me going. I know I'm still on the early stage of my journey and I know that there will be even more harships that will come my way, but what matters is being persistent in learning. Take a rest if you need to, but never quit. Be patient with the results and one day you'll be surprised how far you've come.
