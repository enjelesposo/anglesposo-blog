## Welcome to my blog!

#### Here are the stuff I'll be writing about:
- study journal
- study notes to serve as a review
- stuff I do to keep myself motivated
- I'm studying Japanese too. Maybe I'll write some post in Japanese to practice.

It's my first time writing a blog so some of the stuff here are probably boring and ridden with grammar mistakes. This will be a learning experience. (◕ᴗ◕✿)
